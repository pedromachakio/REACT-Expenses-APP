# REACT-Expenses-APP
First React APP - Expense Tracker @ Udemy


This is the first SPA (Single Page Application) that I am creating in React alongside the Udemy course "React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)".

Although version control is not included in the project I decided to use it to also practice it.
I won't be using the Desktop app but rather just the terminal.
