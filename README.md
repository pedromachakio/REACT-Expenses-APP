# REACT-Expenses-APP
This is a SPA (Single Page Application) expense tracker where you will be able to input your expenses and then filter them by year.

Currently there is, however, no persistence of data and therefore the data is lost upon refreshing the page - this shall be corrected/introduced at a latter stage of the app's development.

This app is being developed in React and is serving as a practical introduction to the library, alongside the Udemy course "React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)".

For version control I won't be using GitHub's Desktop app but rather just the terminal.
